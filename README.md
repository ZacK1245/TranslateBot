# TranslateBot
### Please note this is my first real project so it may be messy, please let me know how to improve!
### NOTE: I DO NOT THINK PLAGIARISM IS A GOOD IDEA, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILTY BY THE USER
## Description
TranslateBot google translates the given word/sentence into random languages 10 times then returns it back to english with the help of [googletrans module](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans) 

TranslateBot may be useful when you need to copy something into a document without being "plagiarize flagged" by a teacher 

## Requirements
I have python version 3.1 but I believe any python version can be used
```
Pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
```
